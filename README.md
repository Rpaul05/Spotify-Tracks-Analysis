## 📊 Project Overview  

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Spotify dataset to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and correlations in music.  
By analyzing audio features such as **danceability, energy, valence, loudness, and tempo**, this project aims to understand what makes a song popular and how music has evolved over time.  

**Author:** Ritav Paul

## 🚀 Objectives  

- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing**  
- Explore **artist, genre, and popularity distribution**  
- Visualize **correlations among audio features**  
- Analyze **year-wise music evolution**  
- Provide a foundation for **future ML applications** (e.g., recommendations, hit prediction)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → Data wrangling & transformation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** → Development environment  

---
## 📈 Key Insights
- 🎤 **Top Artists** → Identified most frequent and popular artists  
- ⭐ **Popularity Analysis** → Distribution and outliers of song popularity  
- 🔥 **Correlation Heatmap** → Energy strongly correlates with loudness  
- 💃 **Danceability Trend** → Increasing over recent years  
- 🎶 **Genre & Feature Evolution** → Pop dominates, but diversity is growing  

## 🎯 Results
- ✔ Strong relationship between **energy & loudness**  
- ✔ Pop songs dominate the charts in popularity  
- ✔ Increasing **danceability and tempo** trends in modern music  
- ✔ Certain artists repeatedly dominate across multiple features  

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Build a **Recommendation Engine** using ML  
- Predict **song popularity** with regression/classification models  
- Deploy an interactive **Streamlit Dashboard**
